This document provides an overview of key data structures and algorithms concepts.

1. Data Structures

1.1 Arrays
Arrays are continuous blocks of memory that store elements of the same type. They provide O(1) access time for elements when the index is known.
Advantages: Fast access, simple implementation
Disadvantages: Fixed size (in many languages), insertion and deletion are O(n) operations

1.2 Linked Lists
Linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
Advantages: Dynamic size, efficient insertions and deletions
Disadvantages: No random access, requires extra memory for pointers

1.3 Stacks
Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end.
Common operations: push (add), pop (remove), peek (view top element)
Applications: Function call management, expression evaluation, backtracking

1.4 Queues
Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at one end and removed from the other.
Common operations: enqueue (add), dequeue (remove), peek
Applications: CPU scheduling, disk scheduling, handling of interrupts

1.5 Hash Tables
Hash tables use a hash function to map keys to values, providing fast lookups.
Advantages: Fast operations (average O(1) for search, insert, delete)
Disadvantages: Potential collisions, may require resizing

1.6 Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes.
Binary trees: Each node has at most two children
Binary search trees: For any node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are greater
Balanced trees (e.g., AVL, Red-Black): Maintain height balance to ensure O(log n) operations

1.7 Graphs
Graphs consist of vertices connected by edges, representing relationships between objects.
Representation: Adjacency matrix, adjacency list
Types: Directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted, cyclic/acyclic

2. Algorithms

2.1 Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort: O(n²) - Simple but inefficient
Selection Sort: O(n²) - Simple but inefficient
Insertion Sort: O(n²) - Efficient for small or nearly sorted data
Merge Sort: O(n log n) - Divide and conquer, stable
Quick Sort: O(n log n) average case - Fast in practice
Heap Sort: O(n log n) - In-place but not stable

2.2 Searching Algorithms
Linear Search: O(n) - Simple but inefficient for large datasets
Binary Search: O(log n) - Requires sorted data
Depth-First Search (DFS): Uses a stack, explores as far as possible along a branch
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Uses a queue, explores all neighbors at the present depth

2.3 Dynamic Programming
Technique to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems
Key concepts: Overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure
Examples: Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, longest common subsequence

2.4 Greedy Algorithms
Makes locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum
Examples: Huffman coding, Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm

3. Big O Notation

Describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of:
O(1): Constant time - Operation doesn't depend on the input size
O(log n): Logarithmic time - Efficient, common in divide and conquer algorithms
O(n): Linear time - Time grows linearly with input size
O(n log n): Log-linear time - Common in efficient sorting algorithms
O(n²): Quadratic time - Inefficient for large inputs, common in nested loops
O(2^n): Exponential time - Very inefficient, grows rapidly with input size

4. Common Problems and Solutions

4.1 Graph Problems
Shortest Path: Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm
Minimum Spanning Tree: Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm
Topological Sort: For directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
Strongly Connected Components: Kosaraju's algorithm, Tarjan's algorithm

4.2 String Processing
Pattern Matching: Naive approach, Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Rabin-Karp
String editing: Longest common subsequence, edit distance
Tries: Efficient for dictionary operations and prefix searches`;
